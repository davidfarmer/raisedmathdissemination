# Raised Mathematics

> ### *Research and dissemination for accessible STEM materials*

The Raised Mathematics project is working to improve the accessibility of
educational, technical, and research materials for people with limited vision.
Specific targets include tactile and audible graphics; mathematics in
Nemeth and UEB braille; intuitive navigation of diagrams and complicated
formulas; and textbooks, research papers, and technical documents
available in braille and in accessible online formats.

## A suite of software tools

The core of Raised Mathematics is a collection of free and open source
software tools:

* [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org).
An authoring platform for technical documents which converts to braille,
to accessible HTML, and to essentially any other output format.  PreTeXt
incorporates all the other components of Raised Mathematics.

* [MathJax](https://mathjax.org)
A JavaScript library which renders math formulas in web pages, converts
math to braille, and provides navigable and spoken versions of math formulas.
MathJax incorporates the Speech Rule Engine.

* [Speech Rule Engine](https://speechruleengine.org/)
Software which parses mathematical expressions and provides access to a
semantic version of the expression, including a spoken description.

* [ARIA Tree Walker](https://krautzource.github.io/aria-tree-walker/)
A method for navigating complicated structures, including chemical
formulas and mathematical equations.

* Evert Rasing's sonification tool (what is the name and link?)

* New tools under preliminary development, including an easier way to author
accessible graphs and diagrams, and an easier way to write mathematics.

## Upcoming activities

On December 21, Michael Cantino will lead an online seminar:

> Alt text and long descriptions for scholarly materials

Participants will learn the basics of describing figures, diagrams, and images,
so that readers can understand the intent of the graphic even if they cannot see it.
Details available soon.
